## Data Cleaning {#sec-cleaning}

See Section @sec-cleaning for details on how the data was prepared.

```{r}

#| label: fig-bill
#| fig-cap: "Bill length vs flipper length"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()

```

Figure @fig-bill shows the relationship between flipper length and bill length.
